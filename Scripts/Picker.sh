This scripts (that should honestly be just a simple command) allows you to pick a color on the screen within the Hyprland Wayland compositor, using hyprpicker to do so.

Why is this a script? Because I have ideas upon improvements and additional features that could come from it, such as color picking history with a graphical menu that shows each color and their value. We shall see.

When using the $(tput setaf 2)--about$(tput sgr0) argument, this message is displayed.
